# ML-Classification

# Protein Expression in mice with Down Syndrome

## Description

The project is divided into four main parts:
1. [Preliminary analysis]
2. [Classification]
3. [Prediction with different algorithms and evaluation]
4.a [Prediction of the expression values of the protein]
4.b [Determination if the test performance of the best model found at 
step (2.) improves if the SOD1_N feature is also used for prediction (and training).]

Programming language: Python in jupyter notebook
The datasets used for the analysis are: training and test datasets

### 1. Preliminary analysis: exploratory data analysis on training data
- Inspection of classes and parameters/proteins
- Inspection of protein expression distribution
- Missing data
- Extreme values
- General look to the proteins important for the prediction of each class
- Feature to feature relationships, collinearity
- Check for unbalanced classes
- Protein division in groups of lowly, medium and highly expressed for each class
- Important proteins for each pair of biological meaningful classes
- Clustering, serch for structure in data 

### 2. Classification: find a model that is able to classify mice in the 8 different classes 
- Feature selection
- Comparison of different classification algorithms
- Test the best algorithm on the test set

### 3. Using the training data, train and compare different regression algorithms to predict the expression value of SOD1 protein given the other feature, usage of robust evaluation techniques to compare algorithms

### 4. Usage of the right model previously found to predict expression value of SOD1_N such that the column in test data is filled

### 5. Determination of the test performance of the model found, if SOD1_N feature is also used for prediction and training
